## Lenovo ThinkPad P51 - ArchBang Linux OS - Issues & Fixes

Recently, I got a new laptop, [Lenovo ThinkPad P51](https://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-p/P51/p/22TP2WPWP51)

Windows 10 Pro was preinstalled on it, and I did used it a few months 
with Windows because I had to wait the 1 TB SSD to arrive. Time came 
though to install [ArchBang](https://sourceforge.net/projects/archbang/)
, my favorite linux distro. Got dual-boot now, with the help of grub.

ArchBang is very lightweight, and has lots of advantages over Windows, 
but you do have to take care of your own dishes, and do some work to 
have everything into place.

In this repo, you'll find issues & fixes that I've encountered in my 
path, with this laptop and ArchBang linux.
