# Issue

I am using tint2 as a panel/taskbar.
The panel is started after login with openbox, by running it from `~/.config/openbox/autostart`

All good for the most part, but sometimes, the tint2 process was crashing with a core dump.

This is the error I was getting from *journalctl*:

```

# Solution

The latest version of tint2 installed using pacman is `17.0.2`
The code repository for it is located here: https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2

Tint2 is not maintained anymore by the original author and the last commit was on January 31 2022, with the message `freeze code`.
With this message it's fair to assume that the code won't receive any other updates.

I cloned the repository and compiled the binary, trying to find out what is causing the crash.
It appears that the issue is with the `skypeforlinux` icon. 
I am starting `skypeforlinux` right after tint2 process is started.

When `skypeforlinux` is not started, tint2 doesn't appear to have any problems.

I found another repository for tint2, which is still not maintained anymore, but it does have some updates to it compared to the original repository.

The repository can be found here: https://gitlab.com/nick87720z/tint2/
It's version is `17.1.3-8`

Here's how you can clone the code and compile it to binary:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/nick87720z/tint2.git
cd tint2
git checkout 17.1.3
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

Using the compiled binary found in the *tint2/build* solved the problem
