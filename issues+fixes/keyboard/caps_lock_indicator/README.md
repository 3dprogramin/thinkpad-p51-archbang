## Issue

I'm having (had hopefully) this bad habit of constantly pressing the caps-lock key even when not needed.
It's like smoking, but I quit that already.

In order to quit doing this too, I though an indicator that shows every time the key is pressed, would help in my awareness about it, and eventually make me stop doing it.

I found this package called [indicator-keylock](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/indicator-keylock/) in AUR, but having an [issue](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/indicator-keylock/#comment-789809) while building it.

## Fix

Solution was to use another program called [caps-indicator](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/caps-indicator/)
Builds without any problem, not as fancy as indicator-keylock, but does the job.
