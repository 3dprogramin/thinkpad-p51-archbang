Fingerprint scanner not working with fprint (libfprint)

Fix
----

Although it's not a fix yet, there is a prototype available on github by [@nmikhailov](https://github.com/nmikhailov)

The prototype can be found [here](https://github.com/nmikhailov/Validity90/tree/master/prototype)

Currently, it can scan your fingerprint and match previous (probably comming from windows) scans
and you can test the LEDs

Not a solution for now, but looks very promising
